# e-foc — Copilot / AI agent instructions

This file is a concise, task-oriented guide for AI coding agents to be immediately productive in this repository.

1) Big-picture architecture (short)
- Purpose: Field-Oriented Control (FOC) for BLDC/PMSM with strict realtime and memory constraints.
- Major components:
  - `source/` — FOC implementations, hardware adapters, application code (formerly `application/motors`).
  - `source/services/` — Application-level services (coordination, scheduling, helpers).
  - `numerical-toolbox/` — Generic numerical algorithms (PID, filters, fixed-point helpers).
  - `embedded-infra-lib/` — Infrastructure: bounded containers, build helpers, toolchain cmake pieces.
  - `simulator/` — Host simulation models for validation.
- Interaction: `source/` implements control logic and uses `hal/` adapters from `embedded-infra-lib` and algorithms from `numerical-toolbox`.

2) Critical developer workflows (exact commands)
- Clone (with submodules):
  - `git clone --recursive <repo>`
- Configure & build host (recommended first step):
  - `cmake --preset host`
  - `cmake --build --preset host-Debug`
- Run unit tests (GoogleTest):
  - `ctest --preset host-Debug`
- Build embedded target (example board):
  - `cmake --preset EK-TM4C1294XL`
  - `cmake --build --preset EK-TM4C1294XL-Debug`
- Coverage/analysis presets are defined in `CMakePresets.json` — use `coverage` preset for coverage builds.

3) Project-specific constraints and conventions (must follow these)
- NO HEAP: avoid `new/delete`, `malloc/free`, `std::make_unique`, etc.
- NO dynamic STL containers in embedded code: use `infra::BoundedVector`, `infra::BoundedString`, etc. (see `embedded-infra-lib`).
- Prefer fixed-size integer types (`uint8_t`, `int32_t`, ...).
- Avoid recursion and virtual calls in ISR/hot paths.
- Favor `constexpr`, `inline`, and `const` correctness for performance.

4) Patterns & code locations (concrete examples)
- Add a new FOC algorithm:
  - Implement code in `source/foc/implementations/` and keep public interfaces in `source/foc/interfaces/`.
  - Add an instantiation in `source/foc/instantiations/` to wire DI and platform adapters.
  - Motor-specific application code now lives under `source/application/` (renamed from `application/motors`).
- Hardware abstraction & factory: see `source/hardware/HardwareFactory.hpp` for how peripherals and adapters are created and injected.
- Numerical algorithms: follow patterns in `numerical-toolbox/` — implement float first, then Q15/Q31 variants, and add typed GoogleTest suites.

5) Testing & CI expectations
- Unit tests run on host using GoogleTest. Use typed tests for multiple numeric types (float, Q15, Q31).
- Prefer small, deterministic tests that do not require hardware.
- If adding platform-specific tests, provide host stubs/mocks in `source/hardware/Host/`.

6) Build system tips
- Presets are the primary interface: see `CMakePresets.json` to pick host vs embedded and board presets.
- Toolchains for embedded boards live under `embedded-infra-lib/cmake/toolchain-*.cmake`.
- `compile_commands.json` is generated in build dirs; use it for language server/analysis.

7) What to preserve from existing docs
- There is an existing, detailed guidance file for the numerical toolbox at `numerical-toolbox/.github/copilot-instructions.md` — preserve algorithm-level constraints from there when editing numerical code.

8) When making changes, be explicit
- Update corresponding `doc/` entries for algorithms and any example in `examples/`.
- For algorithmic code, include numerical properties (stability, range, complexity) in `doc/`.

9) Quick pointers for reviewers / code suggestions
- If suggesting new APIs, prefer interface-driven DI and small, testable functions.
- For performance changes, provide before/after size/runtime metrics and ensure host tests cover correctness.

If any section appears incomplete or you want deeper coverage (build-on-target, hardware flashing steps, or CI specifics), tell me which area to expand.
